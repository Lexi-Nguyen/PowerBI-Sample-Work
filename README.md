## 📊 Featured Projects

### Project 1: Unicorn Companies Global Overview Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive overview of **global unicorn companies**, focusing on their distribution by country, industry, valuation, and funding raised. Users can explore the top unicorn companies by valuation, identify countries and industries with the highest number of unicorns, and analyse investment trends across regions.

The dashboard includes dynamic slicers for country, industry, and valuation range, allowing flexible and user-driven analysis. A **Clear Slicers** button was implemented to instantly reset all filters and return the dashboard to its default view, improving usability and navigation.

Key visuals include a global map to show the geographical concentration of unicorns, bar charts highlighting trends such as the United States leading in unicorn count and Fintech as the most dominant industry, and summary tables for quick comparison.
